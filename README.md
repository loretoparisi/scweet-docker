# scweet-docker
Docker image and `Dockerfile` for (Scweet)[https://github.com/Altimis/Scweet]. Code modified and adapted from source repository to make it working in `Docker`.

## A simple and unlimited twitter scraper with python and without authentification. 

In the last days, Twitter banned almost every twitter scrapers. This repository represent an alternative legal tool (depending on how many seconds we wait between each scrolling) to scrap tweets between two given dates (start_date and max_date), for a given language and list of words or account name, and saves a csv file containing scraped data :  

``[UserScreenName,	UserName,	Timestamp,	Text, Embedded_text, Emojis,	Comments,	Likes,	Retweets,	Image link,	Tweet URL]``  

It is also possible to download and save the images from ``Image link`` by passing the argument ``save_images = True``, If you only want to scrape images, I recommand to set the argument ``display_type = image`` to show only tweets that contain images.  

You can scrape user profile information as well, including following and followers.  

Scweet uses only selenium to scrape data. Authentification is required in the case of followers/following scraping. It is recommended to log in with a new account (if the list of followers is very long, it is possible that your account will be banned). To log in to your account, you need to enter your ``username`` and ``password`` in [env](https://github.com/Altimis/Scweet/blob/master/.env) file. You can controle the ``wait`` parameter in the ``get_users_followers`` and ``get_users_following`` functions. 

The [user](https://github.com/Altimis/Scweet/blob/master/Scweet/user.py) code allows you to get all information of a list of users, including location, join date and lists of **followers and following**. Check [this example](https://github.com/Altimis/Scweet/blob/master/Scweet/Example.ipynb).

**Note that all these functionalities will be added in the final version of the library**.

## Requierments : 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Note : You need to have Chrome installed in your system

## Results :

### Tweets :

The CSV file contains the following features (for each tweet) :

- 'UserScreenName' : 
- 'UserName' : UserName 
- 'Timestamp' : timestamp of the tweet
- 'Text' : tweet text
- 'Embedded_text' : embedded text written above the tweet. It could be an image, video or even another tweet if the tweet in question is a reply. 
- 'Emojis' : emojis existing in tweet
- 'Comments' : number of comments
- 'Likes' : number of likes
- 'Retweets' : number of retweets
- 'Image link' : Link of the image in the tweet
- 'Tweet URL' : Tweet URL.

### Following / Followers :

The ``get_users_following`` and ``get_users_followers`` in [user](https://github.com/Altimis/Scweet/blob/master/Scweet/user.py) give a list of following and followers for a given list of users. Note that each user should start with an uppercase letter. 

**More features will be added soon, such as "all reaplies of each tweet for a specific twitter account"**
